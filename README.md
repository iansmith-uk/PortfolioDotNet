# PortfolioDotNet
A simple portfolio app in .NET Core 3.1.

The aim of this app is to create a very simple portfolio website to showcase projects. At present it shows the first registered users details on the main page (name, email and projects).

Future expansion could make the app handle specific url's to users profiles (eg protfolioexample.com/user/ismith could show details for the user ismith).
